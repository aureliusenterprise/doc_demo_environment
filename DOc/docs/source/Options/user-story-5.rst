----------

When applying data management in an organisation, there are a lot of different aspects to consider. 
The data governance organisation needs to be set up.
Business and technical data governance models need to be set up.
And data quality needs to be monitored.

Keeping an overview of the organisation's progress in all these activities can be a challenge.
The Aurelius Atlas tool lets key stakeholders monitor the entire progress of the implementation, and the overall data governance quality.
It also allows for better decision making on where to focus for the next improvement. 

Every entity in Aurelius Atlas is checked against various data governance quality rules.
The result of this check is available at the bottom of every details page, as well as an indicator in the search results.
An entity can either be compliant with a rule, or not.
All compliant and non-compliant rules are counted. The ratio determines an overall data governance quality score.
This score is shown at the top of every details page.

The following example explains how to review data governance quality from the perspective of a business data steward.
It is their job to maintain data governance quality for their respective domain.
A data steward can use the Aurelius Atlas tool to get an overview of potential issues, and then drill down to the details.
